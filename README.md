## What is the Kudo-o-Matic?
The Kudo project originated from the wish to create common goals for people and teams who work on different projects in order to *strengthen the team spirit*, *collectively celebrate successes* and *ensure transparency* within an organization.

The Kudos-o-Matic was created to keep track of these goals and the progress towards it. 
Users can reward each other for good deeds by giving Kudos to each other and work together to achieve common goals in the form of Kudo-thresholds.
